# Phase 1 — Feature Ideation

## First
- If anything in this skill feels unclear, **open and follow `AGENTS.md`** (repo root).
- If the request is a small fix (“less than a feature”), use the **Fast path** in `AGENTS.md` instead of this skill.

## Goal
Produce a clear, developer-approved **Phase 1** section in `plan.md`.
No code changes. No BML yet.

## Process
1. Ask up to **3** targeted questions if anything is unclear.
2. Write a concise Phase 1 draft in `plan.md` with:
   - **Name** (feature/component name)
   - **Intent** (1 line)
   - **Scope** (what is included)
   - **Out of scope** (what is excluded)
   - **Acceptance** (3–8 checkboxes)
   - **Constraints** (important non-negotiables)
   - **Integration notes** (where it touches existing system)
   - **Open questions / risks** (short)

## Output format (edit `plan.md` only)
Add/replace this section:

## Phase 1 — Problem & Proposal
- **Name:** ...
- **Intent:** ...
- **Scope:** ...
- **Out of scope:** ...
- **Acceptance:**
  - [ ] ...
- **Constraints:** ...
- **Integration notes:** ...
- **Open questions / risks:** ...

## Gate
Stop and ask for approval:
- “Approve Phase 1 so I can proceed to Phase 2 planning?”
