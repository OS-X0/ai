# Project Structure

## When to use
- Establishing or correcting repo layout and module boundaries.
- Introducing new features that need clear placement.

## Workflow
1. Inspect existing structure and naming conventions.
2. Propose minimal adjustments that fit current patterns.
3. Place new files where ownership and boundaries are clear.
4. Avoid renames/moves unless explicitly requested.

## Guardrails
- Keep changes tightly scoped and reviewable.
- Ask at most 3 targeted questions if structure intent is unclear.
