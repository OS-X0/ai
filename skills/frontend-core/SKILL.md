# Frontend Core

## When to use
- Building or modifying UI, routing, state, or data fetching.
- Reviewing frontend changes for consistency and quality.

## Workflow
1. Identify the existing frontend framework and patterns.
2. Follow existing routing, state, and data fetching conventions.
3. Add components with clear props and minimal local state.
4. Validate UX flows and basic error/empty states.

## Guardrails
- Avoid global restyles or component-wide refactors unless requested.
- Ask at most 3 targeted questions if UX expectations are unclear.
